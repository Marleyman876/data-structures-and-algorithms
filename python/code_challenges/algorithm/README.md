## Problem Domain

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: animal
animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue
Arguments: pref
pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return n

## Edge Cases

if dequeue prefered is not dog or cat raise exception
if enqueue is not dog or cat raise none
cannot deques from empty queue
