# Merger

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

## Challenge Summary

Define a function that takes a list sorts it, then merges the two halves back into one list

## Big O

Space = O(n) list can be short or long, thefore  space will equal n.

Time = O(n^2) because you have to go through the list twice i think.
